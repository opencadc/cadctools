usage: cadc-tap index [-h]
                      [--cert CERT | -n | --netrc-file NETRC_FILE | -u USER | -a]
                      [--host HOST] [-d | -q | -v] [-U] [-s SERVICE]
                      TABLENAME COLUMN

Create a table index

To obtain the host associated with a service, execute a subcommand
with the service in verbose mode without specifying any authentication
option

If no authentication option is specified, cadc-tap will determine the
host associated with the service and look in the ~/.netrc file for the
host, and if found, will use the -n option. If not, cadc-tap will look
for ~/.ssl/cadcproxy.pem file, and if found, will use the --cert
option. If not, cadc-tap will use the --anon option.

positional arguments:
  COLUMN                name of the column to create the index for
  TABLENAME             name of the table in the tap service to create the
                        index for

optional arguments:
  -a, --anon            use the service anonymously
  --cert CERT           location of your X509 certificate to use for
                        authentication (unencrypted, in PEM format)
  -d, --debug           debug messages
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           base hostname for services - used mainly for testing
                        (default: www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca)
  -n                    use .netrc in $HOME for authentication
  --netrc-file NETRC_FILE
                        netrc file to use for authentication
  -q, --quiet           run quietly
  -s, --service SERVICE
                        set the TAP service. For the CADC TAP services both
