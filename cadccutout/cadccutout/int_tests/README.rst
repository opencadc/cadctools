Integration Testing
===================

The integration tests here ONLY run within the CADC, currently. These
tests rely on specific cubes for their size, complexity, etc. for
accurate archive testing. Some of the files are also proprietary and
cannot be accessed without proper credentials.

The rest, however, could be obtained through the CADCâ€™s data web service
on demand, but would add significant download time.

Running
-------

The tests rely on a ``/usr/src/data`` folder to contain the original
FITS file to be cutout from, as well as a cutout file to compare to, and
is expected to contain files for each of these archives:

+---------------+--------------------+--------------------------------+

Docker
~~~~~~

Docker is the easiest way to run the integration tests. The
``/usr/src/data`` folder should be mounted as a volume.

Ideally, these would be downloaded as needed, but would need a lot of
extra time to download each of these. The VLASS cube, for example, is
76GB in size.

Example (from the project folder)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 2.7
''''''''''

.. code:: shell

   $ cd /path/to/opencadc_cutout/project
   $ docker run --rm -t -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app -v /path/to/data:/usr/src/data opencadc/astroquery:2.7-alpine python setup.py int_test

Python 3.7 (Astropy bug prevents 3.x for now. See `Astropy GitHub 7856`_)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
